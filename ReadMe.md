## Description
Using a tablet? Ever miss the long gone brightness slider? Want to know the battery status at a glance?

This mini app resides in system tray showing battery percentage and charging status, and with one click, you are free to slide your brightness. Touch friendly and dpi aware. Right click to access additional ui settings.

**Note:** brightness setting function works with most tablets and laptops, but not with desktop monitors. If you have "Change brightness" option in your system setting app, you are probably good to go.
